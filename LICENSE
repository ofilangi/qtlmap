QTLMap is a computer program dedicated to the detection
of QTL from experimental designs in outbred population.
The statistical techniques used are linkage analysis (LA) and
linkage disequilibrium linkage analysis (LDLA) using interval mapping.
Different versions of the LA are proposed from a  quasi Maximum Likelihood
 approach to a fully linear (regression) model.
The LDLA is a regression approach (Legarra and Fernando, 2009).
The population may be sets of half-sib families or mixture of
full- and half- sib families.
The computations of Phase and Transmission probabilities are optimized to be rapid and as exact as possible.
QTLMap is able to deal with large numbers of markers (SNP) and traits (eQTL).

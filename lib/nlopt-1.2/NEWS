NLopt 1.2 (18 November 2009)

* Added Powell's BOBYQA algorithm for box-constrained optimization
  without derivatives, an improvement on NEWUOA.

* Added ISRES genetic algorithm, supporting nonlinearly constrained
  global optimization.

* New functions nlopt_{set/get}_stochastic_population to provide
  optional greater control over the random "population" sizes in
  stochastic algorithms (although it still has a sensible default).

* Bug fix: remove extraneous text accidentally included in nlopt.f Fortran
  include file.

* Bug fix: configure script now correctly handles Matlab installation
  when MEX_INSTALL_DIR is specified manually by the user.

NLopt 1.1 (12 November 2009)

* configure script detects whether --enable-shared is required
  in order to compile Matlab and Octave plugins (as is the case
  on x86_64), and disables compilation of those plugins if
  --enable-shared is not used.

* Added --without-octave and --without-matlab configure options to
  disable Octave and Matlab plugins, respectively.

* Modified COBYLA algorithm to have better support for bound
  constraints.

* Added new NLOPT_ROUNDOFF_LIMITED failure code to indicate
  cases in which optimization breaks down due to roundoff errors,
  in which case it is possible that useful results were obtained.

* Experimental support for nonlinear equality constraints via
  augmented-Lagrangian method.

* Support for compiling under Windows (ideally with MinGW) as a 
  DLL, although you have to manually add #define NLOPT_DLL
  to nlopt.h *after* installing (after compiling NLopt).

* Added several checks for roundoff-related breakdown to NEWUOA code.

* When only a relative error tolerance is specified, no longer
  fails to halt when exact convergence to zero is obtained.

* Workaround for incompatible qsort_r functions in BSD and GNU libc
  by always using my own version; thanks to Wendy Vandoolaeghe
  and Philippe Preux for the bug report and explanation.

* Workaround for gcc 3.4.x conflict with HUGE_VAL definition in Solaris
  (gcc bug 19933).

* Better identification of Matlab-plugin installation directory.

* Fixed identification of Octave-plugin installation directory for
  recent Octave versions.

NLopt 1.0.1 (13 Nov. 2008)

* Allow user to override Matlab-plugin installation directory with
  MEX_INSTALL_DIR.

* Bug fix in my DIRECT code that prevented convergence (DIRECT-L unaffected).

* MLSL needs a nonzero default ftol_rel and/or xtol_rel to ensure that
  its local searches terminate; use roughly machine precision as defaults.

NLopt 1.0 (11 Nov. 2008)

* Initial public release.
